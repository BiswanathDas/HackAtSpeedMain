# HackAtSpeedMain (Still Under Construction)

It is VERY important you read this before you get started.

Hi Folks, Welcome to the HackAtSpeed repository. This is the central location for all of the HackAtSpeed "Getting Started" assets. Hack at speed is NOT a lab like App in a day. There are some guidance materials available. HackAtSpeed is a "Get Started Quick" process that will enable you to really help you start using areas within the Power platform at speed. There is a lab based document that acts as a GUID and uses the Sales based data as the example template. You can either follow this in a step by step approach or use it as a guide and work around the processes. The Lab focuses on prospect data, but there are loads of other industry focused data sets within the hackpacks that you can use. Ill be adding more and more information to the repository as I go and I do welcome feedback. you can also email me on Chris.huntingford@Microsoft.com
